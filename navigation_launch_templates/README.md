# navigation_launch_generators

This package contains the launch templates for various navigation tools. These templates are divided into 8 subgroups:

- **Control**
- **Filtering**
- **Localization**
- **Mapping**
- **Planning**
- **Simulation**
- **Visualization**
- **Utils**

Additionally, the package includes Python-based ROS nodes to introduce useful functionalities for the tools that have already been developed.

The launch files developed in this package are used by the `navigation_deployment` package to enable the launch of navigation functionalities.
